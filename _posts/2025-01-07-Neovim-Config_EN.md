# Neovimtures

## 1. Context and Objectives

How many times have we mistakenly added that malicious character that breaks our
configuration into a thousand pieces? A simple `r` unnoticed over a bracket
and... Surprise! Let's eat a chunk of error messages at the most inopportune
moment!

In this article, I propose to approaching a solution to this by building a
module that will help us not only handle the errors in our own config, but also
make the process of correcting and dealing with them much more friendly.

To this end, this _safety net_ should fulfill the following tasks:

- Load our configuration as usual.
- In case of error:
  - Automatically load a fallback configuration.
  - Give us information on where the problems are located.
  - Ask us whether or not to open the offending file(s) for editing.

Sounds good? Well, let's code it!

---

## 2. Approach:

As we customize our Neovim experience, we will probably accumulate code to
simplify things for us. For example, the
[typical wrapper](https://github.com/polirritmico/neovim.conf/blob/bd78a4eb5d97c890bd10a685993bdee3a64ff182/lua/utils/config.lua#L58)
to `vim.keymap.set`.

A standard way commonly observed in more advanced Neovim configurations, is to
group that code or functionality inside a utilities module; the typical `utils`
module in our `lua` path. Thinking about our future selves â€”and if you have not
already done soâ€”, I suggest incorporating this style or any other to better
organize our configuration and make it more maintainable in the process.

### Current Status

Now, let's look at a standard example config with the following structure:

```terminal
$ cd ~/.config
$ tree nvim/
nvim/
â”œâ”€â”€ init.lua
â””â”€â”€ lua
    â”œâ”€â”€ config
    â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ mappings.lua
    â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ settings.lua
    â”œâ”€â”€ plugins
    â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ etc...
    â””â”€â”€ utils
        â””â”€â”€ etc...
```

In this setup, through `init.lua` the `settings`, `mappings` and `plugins`
modules are loaded. All standard:

```lua
-- nvim/init.lua
require("config.settings")
require("config.mappings")
require("plugins")
```

The problem with this approach to building a configuration capable of supporting
our own inoperability is that any error on those modules will lead to chaos and
we will end up with the default settings. Depending on the case, this can be a
rather frustrating situation, as not only would we be dealing with the error,
but we would be doing so without access to our fundamental settings.

## 3. Our fallback config

For example, I'll show 2 basic settings for me as examples of the content of
this fallback config to explain the criteria I'm following here, the idea is to
include only the essentials.

The first setting, simply demanded by my fingers' memory:

```lua
-- lua/config/mappings.lua
vim.opt.langmap = "Ã±:,Ã‘\\;"
```

> For those curious, on `ISO-ES` keyboards, the `Ã±` key is located to the right
> of the `l` key, and not `;`. With this setting, I not only enable the `Ã±` key
> in normal mode, but also map it to `:` â€”A two-in-one solution (enable the key
> plus "invert" `;` with `:`).
>
> ![ISO-ES Keyboard](iso-es.png)

Without this, every time I press the `Ã±` key (the positional equivalent for
`:`), nothing happens, and common actions like `:w` (`Ã±w`) followed by `ZQ`
won't have the expected effect ðŸ¥². (`ZQ` is equivalent to `:q!`)

In this example, the second fundamental setting for me is enabling relative line
numbers for `[count]`+`j`/`l` style moves:

```lua
-- lua/config/settings.lua
opt.relativenumber = true -- Show relative line numbers
opt.number = true -- Shows the current line number instead of 0
```

Not having any of these settings is a complete nuisance to me. So in the
fallback configuration, they should definitely go.

Obviously, everyone should adjust the content of their fallback configuration to
suit themselves. I suggest aiming for a minimalistic and robust approach.

For the structure of this fallback configuration, let's replicate the same
structure of our normal config. Although, unlike what I do here, you could think
about grouping everything in a single module; the problem with that is that
grouping every module into a single fallback module could conflict with the
logic of the solution presented in this article. So I suggest following this
approach and adjusting it afterward if you like. In any case, let's create the
`fallback` directory and include `settings.lua` and `mappings.lua` inside:

```terminal
$ mkdir lua/config/fallbacks
```

```lua
-- Fallback settings (lua/config/fallback/settings.lua)
opt.relativenumber = true -- Show relative line numbers
opt.number = true -- Shows the current line number instead of 0
```

And also:

```lua
-- Fallback mappings (lua/config/fallback/mappings.lua)
vim.opt.langmap = "Ã±:,Ã‘\\;"
```

Ok, all set. I assume everyone is clear on what goes into their fallback config
by now. Since we've already defined the _what_, now we just need to focus on the
_how_.

## 4. Our fallback module

For loading our configurations, we basically have to implement a wrapper around
calls to `require`, or more specifically, a wrapper around `require` using
[pcall](<https://neovim.io/doc/user/luaref.html#pcall()>). From the error that
`pcall` catches, we will be able to get the necessary info and act accordingly.

### The module

The time has come to show off our lua skills. Let's see the basic form of the
code (in `lua/utils/loaders.lua`):

```lua
---Helper functions used to safely load Neovim config modules.
---@class UtilsLoader
local Loaders = {}

---@param module string
function Loaders.load_config(module) end

---@param fallbacks? boolean `true` to load fallback settings if errors are found.
---@return boolean -- Returns `true` if no errors are detected.
function Loaders.check_errors(fallback) end
```

From here we can infer the idea, instead of using `require("config.mappings")`
we will use `load_config("config.mappings")` and after that, we check whether
there was an error or not with `check_errors()`:

```lua
-- nvim/init.lua

-- require("config.settings")
-- require("config.mappings")
-- require("plugins")

local utils = require("utils")

utils.load_config("config.settings")
utils.load_config("config.mappings")
check_errors(true)
utils.load_config("config.plugins")
utils.check_errors()
```

Why separate loading from error resolution? Because they are two distinct tasks.
First, we want to try loading the standard configuration. Secondly, if a problem
arises, instead of throwing the error immediately, we continue loading further
modules to gather more potential errors. In this way, if more than one module
has problems, we can report them all at once rather than one at a time. This
approach makes the loading process more comprehensive and provides more
information about the issues in a single run.

### load_configs

Let's review the `load_configs` function. We will collect the errors in a table,
which we can call `catched_errors`. We create it at module level so we can
access it later:

```lua
---@type table Collection of errors detected by `load_config` (if any).
Loaders.catched_errors = {}

---@param module string
function Loaders.load_config(module)
  local ok, call_return = pcall(require, module)
  if not ok then
    print("- Error loading the module '" .. module .. "':\n " .. call_return)
    table.insert(Loaders.catched_errors, module)
  end
  return call_return
end
```

### check_errors

Now that we've collected the errors, we still need to handle them. This will be
taken care of by the `check_errors` function:

```lua
---@param fallbacks? boolean `true` to load fallback settings if errors are found.
---@return boolean -- Returns `true` if no errors are detected.
function Loaders.check_errors(fallbacks)
  -- First the happy path:
  if #Loaders.catched_errors == 0 then
    return true
  end

  -- If troubles arrive, we load the fallback configuration:
  if fallbacks then
    vim.notify("Loading fallback configs.", vim.log.levels.ERROR)
    require("config.fallback.settings")
    require("config.fallback.mappings")
  end

  -- Finally, we inform the user
  local msg = string.format("%s\nDetected errors:\n", string.rep("-", 80))
  vim.notify(msg .. vim.inspect(Loaders.catched_errors), vim.log.levels.ERROR)

  return false
end
```

## 5. Improving the code

Why do we load the _full_ fallback configuration and not just what has failed?

That was my first approach, but depending on what we have in both `settings` and
`mappings`, the config could be in an undetermined state. For example, if we
associate a shortcut with some `utils` function or base it on a specific
setting.

Secondly and more importantly, let's not lose focus. The goal here is to detect
that there has been a problem and provide a relatively comfortable environment
to fix it, not to have an instance of Neovim that works with as many features as
possible.

Anyway, with `load_config` and `check_errors`, we already have the basic
functionality we were looking for. However, let's take a small step forward and
add the last point of our goals: asking whether or not to open the file with
problems. As is often the case with Neovim, this is quite simple to do, so we
can use the provided `vim.fn.input`:

```lua
function Loaders.check_errors(fallbacks)
  -- etc.
  vim.notify(msg .. vim.inspect(Loaders.catched_errors), vim.log.levels.ERROR)

  if vim.fn.input("Attempt to open offending files for editing? (y/n): ") == "y" then
    print(" ") -- (I think I added this to make the message look better formatted)
    print("Opening files...")

    for _, error in pairs(Loaders.catched_errors) do
      -- We get the path to the troubled file from the error message
      if error:sub(1, 1) ~= "/" then
        error = string.format("%s/lua/%s.lua", NeovimPath, str:gsub("%.", "/"))
      end

      local path = get_path_from_error(error)

      if vim.fn.findfile(path) ~= "" then
        vim.cmd("edit " .. path)
      end
    end
  end

  return false
end
```

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

> ---Path of the lua config (`nvim/lua/config/`).
> MyConfigPath =  vim.fn.stdpath("config") .. "/lua/config/"
> ```
{: .prompt-info }
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

We can refactor the new code a little, by moving the obtaining-path logic to its
own function, `get_path_from_error`:

```lua
local function get_path_from_error(str)
  if str:sub(1, 1) == "/" then
    return str
  end

  return string.format("%s/lua/%s.lua", NeovimPath, str:gsub("%.", "/"))
end
```

I will add it inside `check_errors` to avoid parsing it if no errors are found,
but it could just as well be defined as a `UtilsLoader` or a local function.

## 6. Putting the parts together

Incorporating all this into the final code, and since we are civilized people,
we take the opportunity to add the corresponding annotations to assist our LSP
server in its noble and chivalrous task:

```lua
---Helper functions used to load Neovim config modules.
---@class UtilsLoader
local Loaders = {}

---@type table Collection of errors detected by `load_config` (if any).
Loaders.catched_errors = {}

---_Helper function to load the passed module._
---
---If the module returns an **error**, then print it and store it in the
---`catched_errors` table.
---@param module string Name of the module to load.
---@return any call_return Return of the require module call (if any).
function Loaders.load_config(module)
  local ok, call_return = pcall(require, module)
  if not ok then
    print("- Error loading the module '" .. module .. "':\n " .. call_return)
    table.insert(Loaders.catched_errors, module)
  end
  return call_return
end

---_Helper function to handle detected `load_config` errors_
---
---If an error is detected it will load the fallback settings and **ask the
---user** to open or not the offending file.
---@param fallbacks? boolean `true` to load fallback settings if errors are found.
---@return boolean -- Returns `true` if no errors are detected.
function Loaders.check_errors(fallbacks)
  if #Loaders.catched_errors == 0 then
    return true
  end

  local function get_path_from_error(str)
    if str:sub(1, 1) == "/" then
      return str
    end

    return string.format("%s/lua/%s.lua", NeovimPath, str:gsub("%.", "/"))
  end

  if fallbacks then
    vim.notify("Loading fallback configs.", vim.log.levels.ERROR)
    require("config.fallback.settings")
    require("config.fallback.mappings")
  end

  local msg = string.format("%s\nDetected errors:\n", string.rep("-", 80))
  vim.notify(msg .. vim.inspect(Loaders.catched_errors), vim.log.levels.ERROR)

  if vim.fn.input("Attempt to open offending files for editing? (y/n): ") == "y" then
    print(" ")
    print("Opening files...")
    for _, error in pairs(Loaders.catched_errors) do
      local path = get_path_from_error(error)

      if vim.fn.findfile(path) ~= "" then
        vim.cmd("edit " .. path)
      end
    end
  end
  return false
end

return Loaders
```

But when has _the final_ version of any code ever actually been _the final_? The
most attentive readers will have noticed by now that we have actually ignored an
important part of the problem. Let's look at our `init.lua` example:

```lua
local utils = require("utils")

utils.load_config("config.settings")
utils.load_config("config.mappings")
check_errors(true)
utils.load_config("config.plugins")
utils.check_errors()
```

And what happens inside `require("utils")`? What if there is a bug in there?

Well, it would fail, and all of our work would be for nothing.

## 7. Back to the beginning?

No. This is not like the typical subscription article on _Medium_ that abandons
us the moment we think a little on our own and venture a few millimeters out of
its main frame (ðŸ˜—ðŸŽ¶). Remember that we already have our `UtilsLoader` module
working, and therefore, there is nothing left to do but apply our `loader` to
â€”in full _Inception_ styleâ€” load the `utils` itself.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
![Ouroboros](ouroboros.jpg)
_Loading the loader of the loader_
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

This is the content of my `utils/init.lua` file, which is responsible for
incorporating the different modules in one (edited to avoid distractions):

```lua
---A collection of custom helper functions.
---@class Utils
---@field config UtilsConfig
---@field custom UtilsCustom
---@field helpers UtilsHelpers
local Utils = {}

Utils.config = require("utils.config")
Utils.custom = require("utils.custom")
Utils.helpers = require("utils.helpers")

return Utils
```

In the same way as in our main `init`, we have replaced the `require` calls with
those of our own module. Here, we can do the same and even go a little further
by adding a _loaders loader_.

First, we load our `loaders` module and replace the `require` calls with it:

```lua
---@class Utils
local Utils

local loaders = require("utils.loaders")

-- load the utils modules
Utils.config = loaders.load_config("utils.config")
Utils.custom = loaders.load_config("utils.custom")
Utils.helpers = loaders.load_config("utils.helpers")

-- etc.
return Utils
```

But why stop there? What if we have a problem within the `loaders` itself?
Again, `pcall` to the rescue:

```lua
local Utils

local ok, loaders = pcall(require, "utils.loaders")
if not ok then
  vim.cmd("edit " .. NeovimPath .. "/lua/utils/loaders.lua")
  error(string.format("Error in 'utils.loaders':\n\n%s\n", loaders))
end

Utils.load = loaders.load_config
Utils.check_errors = loaders.check_errors

-- load the utils modules
Utils.custom = loaders.load_config("utils.custom")
Utils.config = loaders.load_config("utils.config")
Utils.helpers = loaders.load_config("utils.helpers")
assert(loaders.check_errors())

return Utils
```

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
> This time, I will leave the code directly in the module, but if you want, you
> can create a function. In that case, remember to make the corresponding call.
{: .prompt-info }
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Excellent! Now we have all our loads protected, and we finally have our own
error-proof armored shoes.

If we may, we will now do a little refactoring to group the module loading into
a single function (excluding `loaders` of course) and separate the steps of
loading `utils`, which would only load the `loaders`, from the loading of the
other utility modules:

```lua
---A collection of custom helper functions.
---@class Utils
---@field config UtilsConfig
---@field custom UtilsCustom
---@field helpers UtilsHelpers
local Utils = {}

---Load the loaders
local ok, loaders = pcall(require, "utils.loaders")
if not ok then
  vim.cmd("edit " .. NeovimPath .. "/lua/utils/loaders.lua")
  error(string.format("Can't load 'utils.loaders':\n\n%s\n", loaders))
end

Utils.load = loaders.load_config
Utils.check_errors = loaders.check_errors

function Utils.load_utils()
  Utils.config = Utils.load("utils.config")
  Utils.custom = Utils.load("utils.custom")
  Utils.helpers = Utils.load("utils.helpers")

  assert(loaders.check_errors())
end

return Utils
```

Beautiful.

With this, we must remember that now, in addition to using `require("utils")`,
we must initialize the module with `require("utils").load_utils()`. Also, with
this `load_utils` function, we can easily add parameters to the loading of our
utilities in the future. For example, we could add some profiler, start a DAP
session, or simply avoid loading certain modules in specific contexts.

Now, we just need to adjust our `init.lua` and enjoy:

```lua
local utils = require("utils")
utils.load_utils()

utils.load("config.settings")
utils.load("config.mappings")
assert(utils.check_errors(true))
utils.load("config.lazy")
utils.check_errors()
```

```terminal
$ nvim
```

## 8. Conclusions

I wish I had something like this in the early stages of my _Neovim adventures_.
But nevertheless, even though at this stage I feel like I know what I'm doing
â€”though it's probably just a feeling and I'm likely just writing duplicated
logic most of the timeâ€”, every now and then, this little module saves me from my
own incompetence. And every time I'm in that situation with the working module,
I've thought to myself, "Oh, Neovim is great".

If we're concerned about the performance impact of this approach on your config,
I ran a simple comparison between `require` and `utils.load`. After 20 Neovim
startups, the average difference in time was 0.55ms. To put that in perspective,
if troubleshooting an issue normally takes an extra 30 seconds without the
fallback settings (and of course, that would _feel_ like much more if you keep
pressing `Ã±` to open the command line instead of `:`), the time saved by fixing
a single error equals the load time of 54.545 Neovim executions. In that
analysis, of course, the time spent building all this and going through all this
reading is invaluable pure joy.

Well, I hope it has been an interesting read and that some of the ideas
presented here will be useful, especially for those who, fearful of ruining
their configuration, refrain from exploring the options offered by this
fantastic "editor".

Good luck!

---

If you are curious, I use this technique in my own configuration. You can check
it out [here](https://github.com/polirritmico/neovim.conf). It's essentially the
same as what I've shown here, but with some additions like handling lazy specs
and debugging capabilities.
